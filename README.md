# WebsiteX

## Purpose of this project

* WebsiteX is the first website I created for exercise purposes. This is the first year of me in the IT career being a website developer. 
I am using Visual Studio 2017 ASP.NET with .NET framework. 

## Main functionalities I want to add to this website

* I want to create a forum website where registed users can leave messages of 
their interested topics. Upload images, gifs or even short videos.

* Achievements will be awarded to the active users. Example: when they login more than 10 times or leave message more than 50 times, 
they will be given a badge to encourage them to stay.
